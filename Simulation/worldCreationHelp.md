Creating a realistic university campus environment in Gazebo Ignition can be done effectively even without expertise in CAD. Here's a step-by-step approach:

## Requirements
- Environment *must* look realistic (since using computer vision)
- Simulation environment *must* be representative of the environment the robot will be operating in: where exactly will our robot operate? What obstacles must we ensure we include?
- Virtual robot *must* have sensors with a similar perspective to that of the real life robot
- Multiple different virtual robot model sensor setups should exist: allows us to test different sensor types and choose based on effectiveness and cost.
- Environment should not be too heavy to render; must be well optimised.
- **Can we think of anything else to add here?**

## Finding or Downloading Models
Model Sources:

Use online repositories such as Polyhaven, TurboSquid, Sketchfab, or CGTrader.

Search for models in commonly supported formats like FBX, OBJ, STL, or Collada (DAE).


Check for Licensing: Ensure the models are free or properly licensed for use in your project.

## Converting Models to Compatible Formats

Gazebo Ignition supports SDF (Simulation Description Format) files. Most downloadable models will need to be converted into a usable format.

Pipeline:

1. Convert downloaded models into COLLADA (DAE) or Wavefront OBJ if they are not already.


2. Use a tool like Blender to import and export models:

Import the model (e.g., FBX/OBJ).

Optimize geometry (reduce polygon count if needed for performance).

Export as COLLADA (DAE) or directly embed textures in OBJ.

## Creating a URDF or SDF File

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is simpler but more limited.

SDF is the native format for Gazebo Ignition and provides better support for environmental elements.


Using SDF for Static Models:

Hereâ€™s a template for a simple SDF file:

```
<sdf version="1.6">
  <model name="building">
    <static>true</static>
    <link name="link">
      <visual name="visual">
        <geometry>
          <mesh>
            <uri>model://path_to_your_model.dae</uri>
          </mesh>
        </geometry>
        <material>
          <ambient>1 1 1 1</ambient>
        </material>
      </visual>
      <collision name="collision">
        <geometry>
          <mesh>
            <uri>model://path_to_your_model.dae</uri>
          </mesh>
        </geometry>
      </collision>
    </link>
  </model>
</sdf>
```

Replace path_to_your_model.dae with the relative path to your model file.

## Organizing Your Models

Model Directories:

Place each model in a folder with the following structure:
```
model_name/
  model.sdf
  meshes/
    your_model.dae
    your_model_collider.dae
  materials/
    textures/
      your_texture.png
```
This keeps your assets organized and easy to load.


Referencing in Gazebo Ignition: Use the <model/> tag to load your models into the simulation.

## Building the Campus Environment

Use Gazebo Ignition's GUI or a text editor to place models:

Position buildings, trees, benches, and other assets using their coordinates in the SDF file.

Use tools like Gazebo Model Editor to manually place objects in the simulation.



---

## Optimizing Performance

Large scenes can be demanding:

Optimize models by reducing polygon counts in Blender or similar tools.

Compress textures to reduce memory usage.

Use LOD (Level of Detail) if supported.


---

## Testing and Iterating

Load your campus into Gazebo Ignition and tweak placement, scaling, and other properties.

Test the simulation to ensure reasonable performance and visual quality.
